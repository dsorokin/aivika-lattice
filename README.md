Nested discrete event simulation module for the Aivika library using lattice

This experimental [aivika-lattice](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/aivika-lattice) package extends 
the [aivika-transformers](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/aivika-transformers) library 
and allows running nested discrete event simulations within lattice nodes, where
traversing the nodes of branching has a quadratic complexity.
